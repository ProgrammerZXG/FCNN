# FCNN
## A simple FCNN demo,which applys to one dimensional non-linear regression problem,is aimed at helping beginner to learn deep-learning easily.

# Run a demo
1.download the jupyter notebook
2.run the "FCNN.ipynb" with jupyter notebook

# Results:
We choose some training points(red points) from sin(x)
